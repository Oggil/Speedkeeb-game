# Speedkeeb-game

requires python arcade 2.x, use pip install arcade to install it

This is a little game I made in python arcade to test my typing abilities, it is inspired by Joel Yliluoma/Bisqwit's DOS game wspeed. this game was made under an imposed time limit so it lacks polish and was more intended as a challenge for what I could make in that timeframe given no prior preparation, but it's still a fun little game despite these limitations

The controls are made to be intuitive, press enter to start the game and then type the words on screen, press enter to enter a word, there is no win condition so aim for a high score

Some features I didn't get to implement implement were a score leaderboard, difficulty levels, difficulty curves and more dynamic word animations
